# CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier
# Traffic Sign Classfier Project

Tensorflow framework + LeNet architecture to train the traffic sign classifying network.
I was using only the Udacity provided instruments and datasets:

* [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)  
* [Udacity Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)
